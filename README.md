# MBAPPÉ Project
1. [v2 (current)](https://github.com/isi-mube/mbappe-project/blob/main/notebook/project-mbapp%C3%A9.ipynb)
2. [v1](https://github.com/isi-mube/iron-labs/tree/main/project-mbappe)
3. [Original code](https://github.com/isi-mube/data_mid_bootcamp_project_FIFA_MoneyBall)

## About the Project
The objective of this **project** is to identify young soccer players who posses the potential to become **the next Kylian Mbappé**. The [original](https://github.com/isi-mube/data_mid_bootcamp_project_FIFA_MoneyBall) project was completed in 5 days in collaboration with my fellow Ironhack classmates, [Nati](https://github.com/natnaelfe) & [Hugo](https://github.com/HugoIronhack).

This repository is designed to improve my knowledge, redifining the Linear Regression Model, data cleaning processes and functions.

## About the Dataset
After reading the [documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ekrembayar/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset?select=fifa21_male2.csv) we decided to proceed with the following **strategy**:

1. The majority of the data types are **numericals**, so we will work with that to make a Linear Regression model.
2. The **target** for our dataset it will be the `OVA` (overall score) of a player.
3. Through **Exploratory Data Analysis** we will identify the features that contribute to this prediction.

## Changes
`v1` (16/20/2023)
* **Libraries:** This time, we use `os` to be proficent with other ways of opening the data. Also, they were re-organized for readibility.
* **Functions:** The following functions were added `data_info`, `clean_columns`, `check_null_cols`, `check_nan_cols` & `is_significant` to improve our workflow.
* All the work has been documented, explaining everystep and avoiding redudancy
* The project's **size** has been reduced, making it more readble and efficent. From 1.45 MB (7.265 lines) to 904 KB (8.184 lines)
* **Cleaning the Data:** step had been improved and simplified. We added some extra code for visualization of the changes.
* **Plots:** Still not my strongest point. Normalization plots had been improved, also the Linear Regression results.
* **Rounding after normalization** in this case, we did not round our numericals.

`v2` (20/03/2023)
* **Libraries** We decide to not `import math`; our matematical operations come from `numpy` and we don't want unnecesary code.
* **Functions** Erased some of the extra-functions to keep it nice and simple.
* **Features:** We will drop `hits` even if it's a numerical, since it represents the popularity of a player used or watched in FIFA21 community. With that, we also deal with `v1` `hits` outliers issue. Total features in v2; `22`.
* **Plots:** Have been improved.
* **Linear Regression:** For this final version, we will only import `ElasticNet` for our Linear Regression model. Go to [v1](https://github.com/isi-mube/iron-labs/tree/main/project-mbappe) code to see all previous results with `Linear Regression`, `Lasso`, `Ridge` and `ElasticNet`.
* **Size:** Compared to v1, we reduced the amount of lines (from 8.186 to 4808). The final python script size is `1.54 MB`

## Results & Discussion
* R2 =  0.9933
* RMSE =  0.5205
* The value of the metric MSE is  0.2709
* MAE =  0.4092

The **choice** of using **ElasticNet** over Linear Regression was not strictly required and initially happened by **mistake**. As a result, our updated model produced slightly more realistic outcomes compared to the previous [v1](https://github.com/isi-mube/iron-labs/tree/main/project-mbappe) Linear Regression model, which returned perfect predictions (R2 of 1.0).

`v1/v2` ** detailed comparision**:
* R2 increased from 0.9908 to 0.9933, a 0.0025 improvement.
* RMSE decreased by 0.0259, from 0.5464 to 0.5205.
* MSE decreased by 0.0276, from 0.2985 to 0.2709.
* MAE decreased by 0.0199, from 0.4291 to 0.4092.

Through this final version, we expanded our knowledge on regression methods and improved our code documentation and visualization.

## BONUS
Entropy happens. We have a glitch in our code if you're visualizing it on GitHub.
